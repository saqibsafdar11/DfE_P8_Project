# Data Analysis Project: Education Equity

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of positive outlier schools in the UK (2022/23) in terms of their disadvantaged pupils' educational outcomes at Key Stage 4. The analysis focuses on the correlation between school performance, measured through the Progress 8 and Attainment 8 scores, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD).

### Dataset
The datasets for this project were sourced from the Department for Education (DfE) and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). They provide key metrics on school performance and socioeconomic data for the academic year 2022-23.

### Objectives
- Identify schools that perform well above the national average for disadvantaged pupils.
- Analyze the relationship between school performance and socioeconomic status.
- Explore factors influencing positive outliers in school performance.
